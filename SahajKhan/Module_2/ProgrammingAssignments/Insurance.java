 * @author Sahaj Khan
 * The Harrison Group Life Insurance company computes annual policy premiums based on the age the customer
 * turns in the current calendar year. The premium is computed by taking the decade of the customerâ€™s age,
 * adding 15 to it, and multiplying by 20. For example, a 34-year-old would pay $360, which is calculated
 * by adding the decades (3) to 15, and then multiplying by 20. Write an application that prompts a user
 * for the current year and a birth year. Pass both to a method that calculates and returns the premium
 * amount, and then display the returned amount.
 * @version 1.0
